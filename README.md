This is the repository that holds my portfolio page! 
My portofolio page tells you a story about a young hard-working man with a passion to work in the tech industry as a designer and front-end developer. 
I personally coded this page with the Alumn colors of North Carolina A&T becasue that school gave me an experience I'll always tresure. It brought me around
people that'll be in my life forever and A&T is where I realised that I wanted to be a developer.
